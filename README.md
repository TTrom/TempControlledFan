## Credits

Credits go to the FastAI team, Naveen Chanakya, and the Flutter team. I integrated a few different tutorials together to form a SaaS pipeline template. This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/CzPYgRaYWUA) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on building an image classification startup. There are 3 components here; A web API, a model training script, and a mobile app. The code in this repository is for the starter flutter app. Let's go through the 5 step process below. Pull Requests are always welcome!
