## Overview

The Arduino is a great and accesible tool for creating projects ranging from simple to complex. However, if one wishes to properly develop their coding and practice with embedded systems, simply using the Arduino's existing library functions will not be necessarily sufficient. For this project I made a simple device and circuit (a temperature controlled fan) and attempted to work around the Arduino libraries as much as possible in order to observe the effects on the microcontroller's memory.  

## Visual Aids
1. [Arduino Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/TTrom/TempControlledFan/issues/1)
2. [Code Detail PDF](https://github.com/TTrom/TempControlledFan/issues/2)
3. [Atmega168 Pin Map](https://github.com/TTrom/TempControlledFan/issues/3) (Identical to Atmega328 Pin Map)
4. [Program and memory usage](https://github.com/TTrom/TempControlledFan/issues/4)
6. [This](https://github.com/TTrom/TempControlledFan/issues/5) shows the system performance using a program producing the same output but using only Arduino libraries and functions.

## Shortcomings

Though my desire was to code strictly using the instructions from the Atmega microntroller's data sheet, I was not able to figure out the commands for a few of the functions needed by both the program and the Arduino IDE.
